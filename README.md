## 📝 Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow

- Protected routes with custom `ProtectedRoute` component
- Client-side auth state management with React Context

### Data Model
- **Expenses**: Tracks transactions with categories, amounts, and receipt data
- **Budgets**: Monthly budget limits per category
- **Savings Goals**: Target amounts with progress tracking
- **User Preferences**: Notification settings and display preferences

### State Management
- React Context for auth state
- Local state with useState for component-level data
- Firestore real-time listeners for data synchronization

### UI/UX Considerations
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Dark mode support
- Loading states and error handling
- Intuitive navigation with breadcrumbs
- Toast notifications for user feedback
